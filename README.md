Crowd-sourcing Opinions

This program will crowdsource for opinions and form a ordered list from a bag of raw data.
First, it will send each user a question: Do you prefer option 1, option 2, or is the question not applicable (no experience with one or both options)
It will use this as a quick-sort step to create the user's ordered list. This step will iterate until all data is ordered.

While this is happening, as this may turn out to be something which happens indefinitely, the user responses will be aggregated
into a single ordered list. The rankings from each user will be taken into account and the list will be formed from the preferences of each pair, taken from the whole.
This will allow the end product to be an accurate ranking of the preferences of the human computers.

We also have the idea of giving a power to each ranking based on the speed with which an option is selected. 
Perhaps a 1 through 3 or just double if the user votes quickly. This will need discussion.
