Crowd-sourcing Opinions

This program will crowdsource for opinions and form a ordered list from a bag of raw data.
First, it will send each user a question: Do you prefer option 1, option 2.
It will use this as a quick-sort step to create the user's ordered list. This step will iterate 
until all data is ordered.

While this is happening, as this may turn out to be something which happens indefinitely, the user 
responses will be aggregated into a single ordered list. The rankings from each user will be taken 
into account and the list will be formed from the preferences of each pair, taken from the whole.
This will allow the end product to be an accurate ranking of the preferences of the human computers.

In theory, these aggregated lists will rank the popularity of the itemse presented in the question, 
which can be used by advertisers or other recommenders that utilize human opinons for their 
functionailty.
